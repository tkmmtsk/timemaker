# testforreadme

testforreadme is for me to write REAME.md file.

## Description

This README.md origin sample is based on [this website](http://deeeet.com/writing/2014/07/31/readme/)
So, if you don't have a framework for README.md, you may refer this or I recommend you to serch something good framwork for you.

## Demo

I don't have any Demo but you should write here like [this](http://qiita.com/takuya-ki/items/13e445096752b8181de7)

## VS. 

Here is some differences of origin example.
I will write here the differences with itemization.
Here is the sample.

1. testtesttest
2. testtesttest
3. testtesttest

## Requirement

 If I need to use some tools or some libraries, I should write this in here.
 
 E.G.
 "You need to iOS version 10.3.2."
 "You need to download Swift3.0."
 etc....
